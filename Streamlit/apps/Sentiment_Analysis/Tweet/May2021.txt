"@GorkhaCheli Nope, I beg to differ. Virus was always there. Indian vaccines are capable of mutating the double variant as well, so we were kinda ahead of the game. 
Heard about the 85 year old beating the virus with 10+ days in a ventilator?
Only if everyone had those medical facilities!"

Important. https://t.co/yTx6LXmGJD
You utter complete lies while reporting and we can‚Äôt even call out your fucking lies. Have the strength to tell truth. Your father got best medical facility available in India. He did not die due to lack of medical treatment. He died because he caught covid. https://t.co/wF3af8Lo16
Covid is a global epidemic which has killed millions. While reporting on your father‚Äôs death you shld have said that India‚Äôs best medical facility tried to save him but could not. Not say that he died as he did not get adequate medical treatment.
