Dear Ministers/Corporates,
This is appalling, despite the advisory of Central Govt many private companies in Telangana, Karnataka, Kerala, UP, Maharashtra &amp; Delhi refuse to allow their employees to WFH while we face a pandemic as severe as Corona Virus. Corona Virus is (1/5)
(2/5) causing lots of companies to instate mandatory WFH policies. Ironically, Corporates spread viruses of economic inequality, English dominance, &amp; now corona as well. Shutting down colleges &amp; Govt institutions was a great step to tackle corona, but for corporates, there are
(4/5) voluntary closings and allow employees to WFH. Reducing density is both a social responsibility &amp; will help protect workforces. The Government should put a stop to rent payments, mortgage payments and utility payments at least until the Corona Virus is under control.
Now,Social distancing is the effacious medicine to get rid of Corona https://t.co/YHgM8CauMB it has become our fundamental duty to aware at least 10 persons to follow this principle to avoid the deadly virus.
